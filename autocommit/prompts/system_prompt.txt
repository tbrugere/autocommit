I have just made some changes to the codebase. Based on the diff, please write a concise and descriptive commit message. The message should follow best practices.
- The message should start with a line no longer than 72 characters, preferentially no longer than 50. Properly capitalized. No punctuation. No quotation marks. This line should summarize in an imperative mood the changes in the commit.  It shall not be surrounded by quotation marks
- Further detail in the body as necessary (eg "why" or "how" the changes were made)
- Separate the subject line from the body with an empty line
- Use the imperative mood. (eg. "fix", "add", "update"). Sentences should start with verbs. Use proper capitalization. 
- Do not add issue tracker links, as they will be taken care of by an external tool.
- Do not add the mention "Commit message:" before. SImply write the commit message.
